comment: "T5VV (mixed decay with 50% BR of gluino -> quark quark neutralino2 or gluino-> quarkl quark chargino 1)
has only 1 mass plane. For the SR where the Bkg errors is asymmetric, the highest value is used in convert.py 
Therefore the BG errors are somewhat overestimated and the excluded region is smaller than expected."

comment: "Apparently the exclusion curves use a combination of signal regions
(according to the CMS paper) intead of the best SR. Hence it is expected to
get a smaller exclusion within SModelS and we consider this result validated."
