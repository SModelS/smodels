#: name: Cross section limits vs. mass (333 ns, higgsino LSP)
#: description: The expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the product of cross section and branching fraction for direct production of charginos as a function of chargino mass, for a chargino lifetime of 333 ns and with a purely higgsino LSP. The branching fractions are set to 95.5% for $\widetilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1} \rightarrow \widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1,2} \pi^{\pm}$, 3% for $\widetilde{\chi}^{-}_{1} \rightarrow \widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1,2} e\nu$, and 1.5% for $\widetilde{\chi}^{-}_{1} \rightarrow \widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1,2} \mu\nu$, with equal branching fractions and production cross sections between $\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$ and $\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}$. The cross section includes both $\widetilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1} \widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1,2}$ and $\widetilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\widetilde{\chi}^{\mp}_{1}$ production in roughly a 7:2 ratio for all chargino masses considered. The dashed line indicates the theoretical prediction.
