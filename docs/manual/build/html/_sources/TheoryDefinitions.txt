Theory Definitions
==================

The so-called theory module contains the basic tools necessary for decomposing the input model
(either in LHE or SLHA format) into SMS |topologies| and using the output of the decomposition
to compute the :doc:`theoretical prediction <TheoryPredictions>` for a given :ref:`experimental result <ExpResult>`.

We start by explaining the basic components: vertices, Z\ :sub:`2`-even and Z\ :sub:`2`-odd states shown in the scheme below.
The construction of a global |topology| and the |bracket notation| used in SModleS are explained further below on this page.

.. _vertex:

Vertices
--------
Each Z\ :sub:`2`-odd state appearing in a |topology| ends with a vertex (see :ref:`scheme above <topscheme>`)
In most cases vertices correspond to the decay of the Z\ :sub:`2`-odd state.
The only exceptions are topologies ending with a stable Z\ :sub:`2`-odd state.
In this case the last vertex contains no outgoing |final states| and indicates
the stability of the last Z\ :sub:`2`-odd particle appearing in the :ref:`branch <branch>`.

.. _final states:

Final States (Z\ :sub:`2`-even)
-------------------------------

Final states indicate all Z\ :sub:`2`-even states coming out of a vertex (see :ref:`scheme above <topscheme>`).
In most cases, these correspond to Standard Model particles (electrons, gauge bosons, Higgs,...).
Note that, if the input model contains BSM states which are Z\ :sub:`2`-even (such as additional Higgs bosons),
these also appear as final states.
In contrast, stable or long-lived Z\ :sub:`2`-odd particles which might appear in the detector (either as MET or charged tracks)
are *not* classified as final states.


* Z\ :sub:`2`-even **states are defined (and can be easily modified) in** :download:`particles.py <images/particles.py>` 

.. _odd states:

Intermediate States (Z\ :sub:`2`-odd)
-------------------------------------

The Z\ :sub:`2`-odd states are always assumed to consist of BSM particles with Z\ :sub:`2`
conserving decays of the form: (Z\ :sub:`2`-odd state) :math:`\rightarrow`  (Z\ :sub:`2`-odd state') + Final States.
The only information kept from the intermediate states are their masses (see :ref:`scheme above <topscheme>`).
If an intermediate state is stable and neutral, it is considered as a MET signal.

* Z\ :sub:`2`-odd **states are defined (and can be easily modified) in** :download:`particles.py <images/particles.py>`

.. _branch:

Branches
--------

A branch is the basic substructure of a |topology|.
It represents a series of cascade decays of a single initial Z\ :sub:`2`-odd
state.
The figure below shows an example of a branch.

.. image:: images/branchTopB.png
   :width: 40%

Each branch is fully defined by its number of vertices and the number of 
:ref:`final states` coming out of each vertex. The particle labels for the |final states|
may or may not be specified.
If the particle labels of the final states are not specified (such as in the figure
above), the branch belongs to a :ref:`global topology <topology>`. However, if it is dressed with its final states
as in the figure below, the branch belongs to an |element|.

* **Branches are described by the** `Branch Class <../../../documentation/build/html/theory.html#theory.branch.Branch>`_   

.. _topology:

Topologies
----------

Topologies describe the basic structure of an |element|.
Each global topology corresponds to a cascade decay chain *without*
the final Z\ :sub:`2`-even states or  Z\ :sub:`2`-odd masses specified.
Therefore the global topology is fully determined by its number of
branches, number of vertices in each :ref:`branch <branch>` and number of
|final states| coming out of each :ref:`vertex <vertex>`.
As as example consider the following topology:

.. image:: images/globTopB.png
   :width: 40%

It contains 2 branches. The first (topmost) :ref:`branch <branch>` contains 3 vertices
with 1 final state each in the first two vertices and zero in the third.
On the other hand, the second :ref:`branch <branch>` contains 2 vertices with two 
|final states| coming out of the first vertex and zero coming out of the second.
*Notice that, for topologies ending with stable* Z\ :sub:`2` *-odd states,
there are no final states coming out of the last vertex in the branch.*

Topologies are also a useful way to group |elements|. In this way,  topologies represent a list of elements sharing a common basic structure (same number of branches, vertices and
final states in each vertex).

* **Topologies are described by the** `Topology Class <../../../documentation/build/html/theory.html#theory.topology.Topology>`_   

.. _element:

Elements
--------

Elements are *dressed* global topologies, where both the final state (Z\ :sub:`2`-even) particles and the
BSM (Z\ :sub:`2`-odd) masses appearing in the topology have been defined.
An element may also hold information about its corresponding weight (cross-section times branching ratio).
An element is defined by its :ref:`global topology<topology>` properties (number of branches, vertices and particles in each vertex)
plus its |final states|, and a mass array containing the ordered Z\ :sub:`2`-odd masses
appearing in the element.
Below we show an example of an element and the information it contains.

.. _notation:

Bracket Notation
----------------

The structure and final states of |elements| are represented in textual form using a nested brackets
notation. The scheme below shows how to convert between the graphical and bracket representations of an element:


.. _bracketnotation:

.. image:: images/bracketNotationB.png
   :height: 280px

The brackets are ordered and nested in the following way.
The outermost brackets correspond to the :ref:`branches <branch>` of the |element|.
The ordering for the branches is arbitrary and each branch contains
an *ordered* list of :ref:`vertices <vertex>` and each vertex contains an *unordered* list of the |final states|
coming out of the vertex. Schematically, for the example in the :ref:`figure above <bracketnotation>`, we have::

   element = [branch1, branch2]
      branch1 = [vertex1,vertex2]
         vertex1 = [l+]
         vertex2 = [nu]
      branch2 = [vertex1]
         vertex1 = [l+,l-]

Using the above scheme it is possible to unambiguously describe each |element| with a simple list of nested brackets.
However, in order to fully specify all the information relative to a single |element|, we must
also include the list of :ref:`intermediate state <odd states>` masses and the element weight.
The :ref:`intermediate state <odd states>` masses can also be represented by a mass array
for each branch, as shown below:
