Known Issues, v2.1.0
=======================================================

 * pythia8306 may not compile on Mac OS with clang. A simple fix is to fall back to
   pythia8245 by changing smodels/lib/pythia8/pythiaversion accordingly.
 * Due to the default rounding of input BSM masses to 1 digit, values of minmassgap should be integers in GeV units

Known Issues, v2.0.0
=======================================================

 * Version 2.0 can not be used with database binary files built with previous versions
 * Interpolation of experimental results gives slightly different results
   when using older versions of lapack (called by scipy).
 * Signal uncertainties are considered when computing the upper limit
   for the best signal region, but not for the combined one.
 * SUSYHit includes the PDG codes 4000001 and 3000001 for some
   decays. These are not included in the SM particle definitions
   and should be added by the user, if needed.
 * Parallel processing (ncpus > 1) may not work in some machines. Try using ncpus = 1 if this is the case.
