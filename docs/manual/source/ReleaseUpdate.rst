  * Small fix due to an API change in pyhf 0.6
  * Changes in output: :ref:`width values added <pyOut>`, :ref:`coverage groups <coverageGroups>` and others (see :ref:`output description <outputDescription>` for details)
  * Added option for signal strength multipliers in :ref:`cross section calculator <xsecCalc>`
  * Small bug fixes in :ref:`models <basicInput>`
