Basic Input
===========

Basic Model Input
-----------------

SModelS requires two types of input from the user:

 * the :ref:`particle content <newParticles>` of the BSM model (BSM states and their quantum numbers) and
 * the :ref:`model parameters <modelParameters>`, such as masses, widths, branching ratios and cross-sections.

Below we describe how this information should be provided. 

.. _newParticles:

Particle Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The definition of the BSM states and their quantum numbers can be 
provided either in two formats:

* as a python module, as illustrated in :download:`mssm.py <images/mssm.py>`,
* or as a SLHA file containing :ref:`QNUMBERS blocks <qnumberSLHA>` (see :download:`mssmQNumbers.slha <images/mssmQNumbers.slha>`).

The python module is more flexible and allows the user to define their own particle properties, while the SLHA
file can be automatically generated by other tools, such as `MadGraph <https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo>`_ .
A path to the user's own model file (in either format) can be specified 
in the :ref:`parameter file <parameterFile>`, in the *[particles]* section.

.. _modelParameters:

Model Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the :ref:`particle content <newParticles>` has been specified,
the main input for SModelS is the set of model parameters (masses, widths,...), which can be
given in the two following forms:

* a SLHA (SUSY Les Houches Accord) file containing masses, widths, branching ratios and cross sections for the BSM states
  (see an example file :download:`here <examples/example.slha>`)
* a LHE (Les Houches Event) file containing parton level events
  (see an example file :download:`here <examples/example.lhe>`)

The SLHA format is usually more compact and best suited for supersymmetric models. On the other hand, a LHE file can always
be generated for any BSM model (through the use of your favorite MC generator). [*]_ In this case, however,
the precision of the results is limited to the MC statistics used to generate the file.
*We also point out that all the decays appearing in the LHE input are assumed to be prompt and
this input format should not be used if the model contains meta-stable particles*.

*In the case of SLHA input only*, the production cross sections for the BSM states also have to be included
in the SLHA file as SLHA blocks, according to the :ref:`SLHA cross section format <xsecSLHA>` 
(see :download:`example file <examples/example.slha>`).
For the MSSM and some of its extensions, they may
be calculated automatically using `Pythia <http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html>`_ 
and `NLLfast <http://pauli.uni-muenster.de/~akule_01/nllwiki/index.php/NLL-fast>`_, 
as discussed in :ref:`cross section calculator <xsecCalc>`.

*In the case of LHE input*, the total production cross section as well as 
the center-of-mass energy should be listed in the <init></init> block, according to the standard LHE format
(see :download:`example file <examples/example.slha>`).
Moreover, all the Z\ :sub:`2`-even :ref:`particles <particleClass>` should be set as stable, since
in SModelS they are effectively considered as final states.
When generating the events it is also important to ensure that no mass smearing is applied, so the mass
values for a given particle are the same throughout the LHE file.



.. _xsecSLHA:


SLHA Format for Cross Sections
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A list of cross section blocks (one for each production process)
must be included in the SLHA file for the SLHA-based Decomposition. 
The SLHA format for each cross section block is shown below
(see the `Les Houches note <http://phystev.cnrs.fr/wiki/2013:groups:tools:slha>`_):

.. _xsecblock:

.. image:: images/xsecBlock.png
   :width: 100% 

The above example shows the cross section for :math:`pp \rightarrow \tilde{\tau}_1^- + \tilde{\nu}_{\tau}`
at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and at leading order.
The only information used by SModelS are the center-of-mass energy, the outgoing particle PDGs, the cross section value
and the QCD order. *If the input file contains two cross sections for the same process  but at different QCD orders, only 
the highest order will be used.*

* **Reading of cross sections from an input file is
  implemented by the** `getXsecFromSLHAFile <theory.html#theory.crossSection.getXsecFromSLHAFile>`_ **method** 


.. _qnumberSLHA:

SLHA Format for Quantum Numbers
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If the :ref:`particle content <newParticles>` of the input model is specificed through
a SLHA file, it must contain a list of QNUMBERS blocks (one for each particle)
following the format below:

.. _qnumbersblock:

.. image:: images/qnumbersBlockB.png
   :width: 50% 

The above block specifies the particle PDG, electric charge, color representation and spin.
Furthermore, if the first line contains a comment (after the particle PDG), it will be used
as the particle label, otherwise the particle label will be its PDG number.
The entry number 5 (Z\ :sub:`2` parity) is a SModelS specific line which can be added
to specify the :ref:`particle <particleClass>` parity (even or odd). If this
line is missing the parity will be assumed to be odd.
Finally, if the particle is not its own anti-particle (specified by entry number 4),
a second particle will be added to the model with the opposite electric charge
and minus the PDG number.

.. [*] SModelS can easily be used for non-SUSY models as long as they present a  Z\ :sub:`2`-type symmetry.
   However, it is the responsibility of the user to make sure that the SMS results
   in the database actually apply to the model under consideration.
