#: name: Mass limits vs. lifetime, wino LSP
#: description: The expected and observed constraints on chargino lifetime and mass for a purely wino LSP in the context of AMSB, where the chargino lifetime is explicitly varied. The chargino branching fraction is set to 100% for $\widetilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1} \rightarrow \widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1} \pi^{\pm}$. Shown are the full Run 2 results, derived from the results of the search in the 2017 and 2018 data sets combined with those of the previous CMS result obtained in the 2015 and 2016 data sets. The region to the left of the curve is excluded at 95% CL. The prediction from PLB 721 (2013) 252 is indicated in the dashed line.
