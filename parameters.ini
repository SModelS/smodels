model=share.models.mssm ; path to the BSM model file. It can be a python module with definition of BSM particles or a SLHA file with QNUMBER blocks. If omitted, we search in the current working directory as well as "smodels/share/models". MSSM is the default.
promptWidth = 1e-8 ; All particles with widths (in GeV) above this value are considered prompt
stableWidth = 1e-25 ; All particles with widths (in GeV) below this value are considered stable

#Select input parameters

sigmacut = 0.01 ;Give minimum cross section value [fb] considered in SLHA decomposition (relevant for SLHA decomposition and detection of missing topologies)
minmassgap = 5. ;Give minimum mass gap [GeV] for mass compression
maxcond = 0.2 ;Maximum relative violation of conditions for valid results
ncpus = 1 ;Give number of cores used when running in parallel (integer, -1 means all available CPUs are used). Warning: do not change unless you know what you are doing!
