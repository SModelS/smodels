Output Description
==================

A detailed description of the possible output formats generated
by :ref:`running SModelS <runningSModelS>` and their content is given below.
For simplicity we will assume that all printer options
in the |parameters| are set to True, so the output information is maximal.\ [#f1]_

.. _screenOut:

Screen (Stdout) Output
----------------------

The stdout (or :ref:`log output <logOut>`) is intended to provide extensive information about
the |database|, the |decomposition|, the  |theory predictions| and the :ref:`missing topologies <topCoverage>`.
It is most convenient if the input is a single file and not a folder, since the output is quite extensive.
If all the options in **stdout-printer** are set to True (see |parameters|), the screen output contains the following information:

* information about the basic input parameters and the status of the run:

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
   :lines: 1-20

* a list of all the |express| considered (if **printDatabase** = True). Note that this list corresponds to all the results
  selected in the **database** options (see |parameters|). If **addAnaInfo** = True,
  for each |expres| entry a list of all the simplified models (or |elements|) constrained by the analysis
  is also shown using the :ref:`bracket notation <bracketNotation>`:

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
   :lines: 22-34,327-335


* a full list of the |topologies| generated by the |decomposition| (if **printDecomp** = True). Each |topology| entry
  contains basic information about the |topology| as well as the number of |elements| with this |topology|
  and the sum over all the |elements| weights. If **addElementInfo** = True, the |elements| belonging to each
  |topology| are also explicitly shown, as well as the |element|'s mass, BSM and SM final state |particles|,
  weight, the PIDs of the BSM |particles| contributing to the |element| and the element ID:

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
   :lines: 532-594


* a list of all the |theory predictions| obtained and the corresponding |expres| upper limit.
  For each |expres|, the corresponding *id*, signal region (|dataset|) and *sqrts* as well as
  the constrained simplified models (|txnames|) are printed.
  After this basic information, the signal cross section (|theory prediction|),
  the list of :ref:`condition values <ULconditions>`  (if applicable) and the corresponding observed
  upper limit are shown. Also, if available, the expected upper limit is included.
  If  **computeStatistics** = True, the likelihood for the BSM signal, that for the SM hypothesis,
  and the maximum likelihood are printed
  (see :ref:`likelihood calculation <likelihoodCalc>`).
  Finally, if **printExtendedResults** = True, basic information about the |elements|
  being constrained, such as their masses\ [#f2]_, IDs and PIDs, is also shown.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
   :lines: 107644-107765

* information about the combination of results, if **combineAnas** is defined (available from v2.2 onward):

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
  :lines: 109774-109777


* summary information about the :ref:`missing topologies <topCoverage>`, if **testCoverage** = True.
  The total missing topology cross section
  corresponds to the sum of cross sections of all |elements| which are not tested by any |expres|.
  The cross section for missing topologies with prompt (displaced) decays corresponds to the total
  signal cross section going into prompt (displaced) decays which are not tested by any displaced
  |expres| of type *prompt* (*displaced*) (see :ref:`simplified model coverage <topCoverage>` for more details).
  If the |element| is constrained by one or more |express|, but its masses and/or widths
  are outside the efficiency or upper limit grids (see |EMrs| and |ULrs|), its cross section is included in the
  total cross section outside the grid.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
   :lines: 109781-109784


* detailed information about the missing topologies with highest cross sections.
  The |element| cross section (weight) as well as the description of its final states
  (in :ref:`bracket notation <bracketNotation>`) is included for each distinct :ref:`coverage group <coverageGroups>`.
  If **addCoverageID** = True, all the |elements| IDs contributing to the missing topology are shown.
  These IDs can be traced back to the corresponding |elements| using the |decomposition| information
  obtained with **printDecomp** = True and **addElementInfo** = True.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
   :lines: 109786-109794

* information about the missing topologies with displaced decays.
  If **addCoverageID** = True, all the |elements| IDs contributing to the missing topology are shown.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
   :lines: 109800-109801

* information about the missing topologies with prompt decays.
  If **addCoverageID** = True, all the |elements| IDs contributing to the missing topology are shown.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
   :lines: 109802-109814

* detailed information about the topologies which are outside the  |express| grid.
  If **addCoverageID** = True, all the |elements| IDs contributing to the missing topology are shown.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.log
   :lines: 109815-109827


.. _logOut:

Log Output
----------

The log-type output is identical to the :ref:`screen output <screenOut>`, except that it is
redirected to a .log file. The filename is set as the <input file>.log and stored in the output folder
(see the :ref:`runSModelS options <runSModelS>`).



.. _fileOut:

Summary File Output
-------------------

The summary-type output is similar to the :ref:`screen output <screenOut>`, but restricted
to the list of |theory predictions| and model :ref:`coverage <topCoverage>`.
The output is printed to the file <input file>.smodels and stored in the output folder
(see the :ref:`runSModelS options <runSModelS>`).

Below we describe in detail the blocks contained in the summary output:

* information about the basic input parameters and the status of the run:

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodels
   :lines: 1-20

* a list of all the |theory predictions| obtained and the corresponding |expres| upper limit.
  If **expandedSummary** = False only the most constraining |expres| is printed.
  For each |theory prediction| entry, the corresponding |expres| *id*, the signal region (|dataset|) used (only for |EMrs|)
  and the |expres| *sqrts* is printed. Furthermore, the |txnames| contributing to the signal cross section, the
  theory cross section (*Theory_Value*), the observed upper limit (*Exp_limit*),
  the (theory cross section)/(observed upper limit) ratio (*r*) and, when available,
  the (theory cross section)/(expected upper limit) ratio (*r_expect*) are also printed.
  For |ULrs| the condition violation (see :ref:`upper limit conditions <ULconditions>`) is also included.
  Finally, if  **computeStatistics** = True, the likelihood values (for |EMrs|) are printed:

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodels
   :lines: 22-41

* the maximum r value, that is the highest (theory cross section)/(observed upper limit) ratio. If this value is
  greater or equal 1, the input model is likely excluded by one of the |express| (see :ref:`confronting predictions <confrontPredictions>`).  For a more informed statistical interpretation, from v2.1 onward the ATLAS and CMS analyses with highest available *expected* r values are reported in addition.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodels
   :lines: 513-515

* information about the combination of results, if **combineAnas** is defined (available from v2.2 onward):

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodels
 :lines: 517-520

* summary information about the :ref:`missing topologies <topCoverage>`, if **testCoverage** = True.
  The total missing topology cross section
  corresponds to the sum of cross sections of all |elements| which are not tested by any |expres|.
  The cross section for missing topologies with prompt (displaced) decays corresponds to the total
  signal cross section going into prompt (displaced) decays which are not tested by any displaced
  |expres| of type *prompt* (*displaced*) (see :ref:`simplified model coverage <topCoverage>` for more details).
  If the |element| is constrained by one or more |express|, but its masses and/or widths
  are outside the efficiency or upper limit grids (see |EMrs| and |ULrs|), its cross section is included in the
  total cross section outside the grid.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodels
   :lines: 524-527


* detailed information about the missing topologies with highest cross sections.
  The |element| cross section (weight) as well as the description of its final states
  (in :ref:`bracket notation <bracketNotation>`) is included for each distinct :ref:`coverage group <coverageGroups>`.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodels
   :lines: 529-541

* information about the missing topologies with displaced decays.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodels
   :lines: 543-544

* information about the missing topologies with prompt decays.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodels
   :lines: 545-557

* information about the topologies which are outside the  |express| grid

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodels
   :lines: 558-570

.. _pyOut:

Python Output
-------------

The Python-type output is similar to the :ref:`screen output <screenOut>`, however
converted to a Python dictionary. If all options are set to True,
it includes information about the |decomposition|, the list of |theory predictions| and :ref:`simplified model coverage <topCoverage>`.
The output is printed to the file <input file>.py and stored in the output folder
(see the :ref:`runSModelS options <runSModelS>`).

Below we describe in detail the dictionary keys and values contained in the Python dictionary output:

* information about the basic input parameters and the status of the run stored under the *OutputStatus* key:

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.py
   :lines: 1-2


* a full list of the |elements| generated by the |decomposition| (if **addElementList** = True) stored
  under the *Element* key. Each list entry contains basic information about the |elements|.
  The list can be considerably long, so it is recommended to
  set **addElementList** to False, unless the |decomposition| information is required by the user.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.py
   :lines: 3-4, 41-42


* a list of all the |theory predictions| obtained for the |express|, stored under the *ExptRes* key.
  For each list entry, the corresponding result *id*, the |expres| type (if |ULr| or |EMr|),
  the signal region (|dataset| ID), the *sqrts* and luminosity, the constrained simplified models (|txnames|),
  the signal cross section (theory prediction), the corresponding observed
  upper limit and the maximum condition violation (see :ref:`upper limit conditions <ULconditions>`) are shown.
  Furthermore, the masses and widths\ [#f3]_ of the |elements| contributing to the signal cross section, the
  individual contribution of each |txname| (if **addTxWeights** = True) and the likelihood values
  (if **computeStatistics** = True) are also included.

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.py
   :lines: 55-55

* information about the combination of results, if **combineAnas** is defined (available from v2.2 onward):

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.py
   :lines: 60-60

* the total cross section in each :ref:`missing topology group <coverageGroups>`  (if **testCoverage** = True) followed by a list
  of |elements| contributing to the group.
  For each missing topology (element) the missing cross section (weight), the IDs of the |elements| contributing
  to the topology and its description in :ref:`bracket notation <bracketNotation>`
  is included (see :ref:`missing topology group <coverageGroups>`).

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.py
   :lines: 56-59

.. _xmlOut:

XML Output
----------

The xml-type output is identical to the :ref:`python output <pyOut>`, however
converted to a xml format. The output is printed to the file <input file>.xml and stored in the output folder
(see the :ref:`runSModelS options <runSModelS>`).

Since the output information and options are the same as described for :ref:`python output <pyOut>`,
we simply show below an excerpt of the xml file to illustrate the output format:

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.xml
   :language: xml
   :lines: 13-39


.. _slhaOut:

SLHA Output
-----------

An SLHA-type output format is also available containing a summary of
the |theory predictions| and  :ref:`simplified model coverage <topCoverage>`.
The file contains the SLHA-type blocks: *SModelS_Settings*, *SModelS_Exclusion* and
*SModelS_Coverage*.
Below we give a description of each block together with a sample output.

* information about the main input parameters:

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodelsslha
   :lines: 1-11

* information about the status of the input model: excluded (1), not excluded (0) or not tested (-1):

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodelsslha
   :lines: 13-14

* followed by the list of experimental results. If  **expandedOutput** = True, all results are printed. Otherwise,
  if the model is excluded, all results with :math:`r`-value greater than one are shown and if the point is not excluded,
  only the result with the highest :math:`r`-value is displayed.
  For each experimental result, the :ref:`Txname <TxName>`, the :math:`r`-value,
  the :ref:`condition violation <ULconditions>` and the experimental result ID are shown.
  If **computeStatistics** = True, the likelihood values
  for |EMrs| are also printed:

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodelsslha
   :lines: 15-23

* information about the combination of results, if **combineAnas** is defined (available from v2.2 onward):

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodelsslha
 :lines: 1175-1181


* the label of each :ref:`coverage group <coverageGroups>` (first entry) and the total cross section in each group (second entry) (if **testCoverage** = True):

.. literalinclude:: /images/gluino_squarks.slha.smodelsslha
   :lines: 1184-1192


.. _scanSummary:

Multiple Files Summary Output
-----------------------------

When running SModelS over multiple files it might be desirable to have a simplified output with a summary
of the results for each input file. Since version 2.1 this information is stored by default in the 'summary.txt'
file in the output folder. This text file contains a single line for each input file and provides basic information
about the SModelS results. This information includes the most constraining analysis (the one with largest observed r),
the respective expected r-value (if available) and the most sensitive ATLAS and CMS analyses (the ones with largest expected r), as shown below:

.. literalinclude:: /images/scan_summary.txt
   :lines: 1-8


.. [#f1] Some of the output may change depending on the code and database versions used.

.. [#f2] The mass shown corresponds to an average mass over all the |elements| contributing
       to the theory prediction. In the case where the |elements| have distinct |topologies|
       no mass is shown.

.. [#f3] For particles considered with prompt decays (see :ref:`promptWidth parameter <parameterFileModel>`), the width is replaced by 'prompt',
       while for particles considered stable (see see :ref:`stableWidth parameter <parameterFileModel>`), the width is replaced by 'stable'.
       If more than one |element| contributes to the theory prediction, the average widths and masses of the BSM states
       are shown.
