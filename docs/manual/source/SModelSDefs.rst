Basic Concepts and Definitions
==============================

Throughout this manual, several concepts are used extensively. Here we define the most important ones,
their respective nomenclature and some useful notation.
The concepts related to the basic building blocks of the :doc:`decomposition <Decomposition>`
of a full model into a sum of Simplified Models (or :ref:`elements <element>`)
are described in :ref:`Theory Definitions <theoryDefs>`,
while the concepts relevant for the database of experimental 
results are given in :ref:`Database Definitions <databaseDefs>`.
