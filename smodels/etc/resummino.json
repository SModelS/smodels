"""
channels: Value (in square bracket) represent the pdg code of the daugther particles to consider,
key is not important here in general, you can choose 1,2,3,4,5, etc. by default

mode: If you want to calculate all the channel you chose at every order, use 'all', if you want
to check at LO before calculating NLO, use 'check' instead. The limit for the NLO calculation is determined 
by the 'mode_limit' variable, below this value (in pb), no NLO cross-section are calculated.

pdfs: You can use the pdfs part to change the parton distribution function used for the cross-section calculation.
We used PDFLHC2021 by default, but any pdf can be used. Be sure to check the name on the lhapdf website before putting
any value here.
