#: name: Cut-flow table for 700 GeV (higgsino LSP) 2018B
#: description: Predicted signal yields for the 2018B data-taking period, corresponding to $38.6\,\text{fb}^{-1}$, after the application of each search requirement for three chargino lifetime hypotheses ($\tau = 0.3$, $3.3$, and $33\,\text{ns}{}$) with a chargino mass of $700\,\text{GeV}{}$ in the case of a purely higgsino neutralino LSP. Excepting the final three, the requirements listed are cumulative such that only the events and objects passing a given requirement are considered in subsequent requirements. In the case of the final three requirements on the number of tracker layers with measurement, these are exclusive signal category selections where only one is applied for each category. The uncertainties are only the statistical uncertainties resulting from the sizes of the generated samples.
