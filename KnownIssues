Known Issues, v1.1.0
=======================================================

 * In case of a very heavy ~uR, the cross section computations (done by pythia6) 
   for the other squarks can be quite wrong, since the phase space is initialized 
   for all squarks using the ~uR mass. 

 * Memory consumption can be quite high, especially in multi-core mode.
   (There is no memory sharing between the processes). 
   We intend to improve this in v1.2.

 * If the database is rebuilt (e.g. because the content of the text database 
   has been changed), the interpolations of the upper limits can vary
   by tiny amounts depending on a machine's specific CPU. As a consequence,
   the final results may differ slightly.
   We intend to make the code fully machine-independent in v1.2.
