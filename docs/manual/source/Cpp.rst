C++ Interface
=============


Since v1.1.1, a simple C++ interface is provided, see
the *smodels/cpp* directory in the source code.

Its usage is documented in run.cpp:

.. highlight:: C++
.. literalinclude:: /examples/run.cpp

A sample Makefile is also provided in the same directory. The python header
files have to be installed; on debian-based systems the package name is
*libpython3-dev*, on rpm-based systems it is usually called *python3-devel*.
