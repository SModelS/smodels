comment: "There is some overexclusion around msquark = 700 GeV. The cross-section and efficiencies seem consistent with the official result.
A possible reason is that the official data grid is quite sparse, resulting in some interpolation uncertainties. Otherwise everything
seems consistent and we use this result."
