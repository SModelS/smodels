#: name: Mass limits vs. lifetime, higgsino LSP
#: description: The expected and observed constraints on chargino lifetime and mass for a purely higgsino LSP in the context of AMSB, where the chargino lifetime is explicitly varied. The chargino branching fraction is set to 95.5% for $\widetilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1} \rightarrow \widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1,2} \pi^{\pm}$, 3% for $\widetilde{\chi}^{-}_{1} \rightarrow \widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1,2} e\nu$, and 1.5% for $\widetilde{\chi}^{-}_{1} \rightarrow \widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1,2} \mu\nu$, with equal branching fractions and production cross sections between $\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$ and $\widetilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}$. The region to the left of the curve is excluded at 95% CL. The prediction from Phys. Lett. B 781 (2018) 306 is indicated in the dashed line.
