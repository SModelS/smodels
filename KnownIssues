Known Issues, v1.2.4
=======================================================

 * The pyhf backend becomes very slow when running SModelS on many cores

Known Issues, v1.2.0
=======================================================

 * Version 1.2.0 can not be used with database binary files built with previous versions
 * Interpolation of experimental results gives slightly different results
   when using older versions of lapack (called by scipy).
 * Signal uncertainties are considered when computing the upper limit
   for the best signal region, but not for the combined one.
 * SUSYHit includes the PDG codes 4000001 and 3000001 for some
   decays. These are not included in the SM particle definitions
   and should be added by the user, if needed.
